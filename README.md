# glob-concat-cli

> A command-line interface for concatenating files leveraging [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#fast-glob).

## Key features

- Quick and easy concatenation of files on the command line
- Supports robust glob patterns via [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#pattern-syntax)
- Automatically ignores empty files by default (great for use with automated build tools)
- Can output to stdout or a new or existing file
- Provides a sourcemap for the concatenated files by default

## Install

```sh
npm install --dev glob-concat-cli
```

```sh
yarn add --dev glob-concat-cli
```

Currently, this project supports node v22 and v24. We plan to deprecate support for node v22 by March of 2026.

## API

### `files`

Type: `string[]`<br>
Alias: `f`<br>
Required: `true`

The files to concatenate. Supports glob patterns via fast-glob. This is the only required option.

### `output`

Type: `string`<br>
Alias: `o`<br>
Default: `stdout`

The file to output the concatenated files to. If not provided, the concatenated files will be output to stdout.

### `allowEmpty`

Type: `boolean`<br>
Alias: `ae`<br>
Default: `true`

Whether to fail the command if no files are found or if any of the provided inputs can't be found. If set to `true`, the command will exit with a status code of `0` and no output will be written.

### `sourcemap`

Type: `boolean`<br>
Alias: `map`<br>
Default: `true`

Whether to output a sourcemap for the concatenated files. If set to `false`, no sourcemap will be written to disk.

### Other supported options

When leveraging this package, you can also pass in any of the options supported by [fast-glob](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#options-3).

Due to how this utility is built, the following options are not supported:

- `onlyDirectories` (this is always set to `false` because this utility is meant to concatenate files only)
- `stats`
- `objectMode`
